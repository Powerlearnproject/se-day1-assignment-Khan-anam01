#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systemcatic application of engineering principle, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

importance
Software engineering ensures that systems can scale effectively to handle increased loads without performance degradation, which is vital for maintaining seamless user experiences.
Software engineering drives innovation by enabling the creation of cutting-edge technologies and solutions, supporting digital transformation across various industries.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming(1960s and 1970s): which empasized in the use of clear and modular code to make software easier to understand and maintain
object oriented programming(1960s): which introduced concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction which helped programmers to develop complex software systems more affectively and efficiently.
establishment of software engineering as a descipline(1960s): this helped encourage more people to venture into software engineering thereby boosting inovation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement - the is where the projects feasibility is evaluated by assessing technical requirements, estimated costs and performing risk analysis.
design - This involves creating the software's architecture and detailed design specifications.
implementation - In this phase, the design is transformed into a functional application through coding.
testing - this involves identifying and fixing defects to ensure the software operates as intended.
deployment this involvers releasing the software to end users which may involve beta-testing or pilot launch to ensure smooth user adoption.
maintenance -this involves continuous support and maintenance to address user issues, apply updates, and add new features.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall follows a linear and sequential process, where each phase—requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment—is completed before moving to the next. This makes it rigid and less adaptable to changes once development begins.
waterfall has minimal customer involvement after the initial planning.
waterfall would be appropriate for a manufacturing process automation project which usually have pre-established processes that require precision and stability.

agile is iterative and incremental, allowing for continuous reassessment and modifications throughout the development cycle.
agile emphasizes ongoing collaboration with stakeholders to refine requirements.
agile would be appropriate for a game development project which often involve interactive testin, feature adjustment and frequent enhancementbased on player feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications and also collaborate with other team members such as designers throughout the software development life cycle.
Quality assurance engineers are responsible for testing software applications to ensure they meet the required standards and specifications which involve creating test cases, executing tests and identifying defects.
Project managers lead cross-functional teams, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned with project objectives. This involves coordinating with developers, QA engineers, and other team members.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time feedback, which help reduce coding errors and improve overall code quality, example include the Intellij IDEA.
VCS provides a safety net by storing a history of changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. This reduces the risk associated with making significant changes to the codebase, example include Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
complexity: Software systems can become increasingly complex over time, making it difficult for engineers to maintain and update the software effectively.
changing requirements: User requirements and business needs can change over time, necessitating significant changes to the software.
legacy Systems and Technical Debt: Maintaining outdated systems and managing technical debt.

strategies to help overcome the challenges:
use design patterns, modularization, and effective documentation to manage complexity.
use agile development methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, to respond to changing requirements quickly and efficiently.
gradually refactor legacy code into modern standards and implement modular designs to reduce technical debt

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: focuses on testing individual units of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation.
integration testing: involves combining two or more units of code to verify that they work together seamlessly.
system testing: evaluates the entire software system to ensure it meets all functional requirements.
acceptance testing: involves verifying that the software meets the agreed-upon business and user requirements.

importance:
unit testing helps catch bugs early, reducing debugging time and ensuring that each component of the software works as expected.
integration testing identifies issues that arise when different components interact, ensuring that the overall system functions as intended.
system testing provides confidence that the software is ready for end-users by verifying that all components work harmoniously.
acceptance testing ensures that the software provides the expected business value and meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively interact with AI models, such as large language models(LLM).

importance:
improves User Experience – clear and well-defined prompts lead to smoother and more intuitive AI interactions, making the model more useful across different applications.
enhances Response Accuracy – well-structured prompts help AI models generate more precise and relevant answers by reducing ambiguity.
enables Customization and Control – users can tailor responses by specifying context, format, or constraints within the prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: Create a lesson plan for teaching Python programming.
improved prompt: Create a lesson plan focused on building data analysis skills with Python using pandas and Matplotlib to analyze real-world datasets (e.g., sports statistics or weather data).
this specifies a skill (data analysis), tools (pandas/Matplotlib), and relatable datasets to ensure practical application.
